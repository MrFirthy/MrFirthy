## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ashley. I'm the Global Director of Engineering for [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy), and an invited expert for the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL) on accessibility guidelines.

You can find out about my work, writing, and speaking [on my portfolio site](https://mrfirthy.me/).

### [Practical Web Inclusion & Accessibility (2nd Edition)](https://learna11y.com)
My second edition of my book "Practical Web Accessibility" is out now. This book will guide you through a broad range of access needs, the barriers users often face, and provide practical advice on how your sites can help rather than hinder. If you're new to the world of accessibility, this book can really help.
